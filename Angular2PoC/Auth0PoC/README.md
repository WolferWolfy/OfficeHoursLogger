# Auth0 + Angular 2 with angular2-jwt

This repo has examples of using Auth0 with Angular 2 for both Webpack and SystemJS. It uses Auth0's [angular2-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt) module.

The Webpack sample is based on [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) by [gdi2290](https://github.com/gdi2290) and SystemJS on [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) by [Pawel Kozlowski](https://twitter.com/pkozlowski_os).

Clone this repo and work from either the SystemJS or Webpack directory based on your needs. You can find further instructions in the readme documents of each example.
